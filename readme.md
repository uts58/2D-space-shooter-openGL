# Retro 2D Space Shooter

Dive into the nostalgia of classic 2D space shooting games! Crafted with C++, OpenGL, and powered by IrrKlang Audio Driver. This game has been optimized for 1080p monitors to deliver the best visual experience.

This game was initially crafted in 2016 as one of my early school projects. Over time, my skills have evolved, and I felt the need to revisit, refine, and restructure the code. Moreover, I've transitioned this from a Visual Studio setup to a more versatile CMake project.

**Note**: To get this game up and running, ensure you have the **VISUAL STUDIO TOOLCHAIN**. Don't worry about the dependencies â€“ I've got you covered! All the necessary libraries and DLL files are bundled in, and CMake is configured to handle their deployment seamlessly.

## Game Features:
- **Difficulty Settings**: Choose between Easy or Hard modes.
- **Health Monitor**: Keep an eye on your ship's health.
- **Collision Alert**: Advanced detection for any space hurdles.
- **Dynamic Soundtracks**: Elevate your experience with immersive music.
- **Interactive Menu**: For an intuitive game setup.
